## **Introduction**

**Insighter** is a responsive web application designed to provide users with the latest information on **movies**, **books**, and **places** using public APIs. The application offers a **user-friendly interface** optimized for **mobile, desktop, and tablet views**. 

I developed this project within a **very limited timeframe** as part of my application for the **Lepton Games Internship**. Despite the time constraints, I successfully implemented the following technologies and features:

- **Next.js** for building the web application.
- **Tailwind CSS** and **ShadCN** for styling and UI design.
- **Axios** for API requests.
- **Public APIs**:
  - **Movies**: OpenMRS API.
  - **Books and Places**: Unsplash Developer API for images.

This project demonstrates my ability to deliver a functional and visually appealing application quickly while adhering to responsive design principles.

## **Features**

- **Mobile-first Design**: Fully responsive interface for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- **Real-time Data**: Fetches dynamic content from public APIs for movies, books, and places.
- **Modern UI**: Clean and intuitive design built with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN.
- **Easy Setup**: The application is simple to run without needing additional environment configurations.

## **Setup Instructions**

To run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository using SSH:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-ssh-link>
Navigate to the project directory:
bash

cd insightview
Install dependencies:
bash

npm install
Start the development server:
bash

npm run dev
Note: I have exposed the APIs and keys in the code to ensure that the application runs smoothly without requiring a .env file. This was done intentionally to make it easier for reviewers to test and evaluate the project.

Live Demo

Motivation
The concept and design of this project were inspired by a Figma design that motivated me to create a clean and visually appealing application. I built this project with the goal of showcasing my skills in web development and my ability to work under tight deadlines.

This project is just the beginning, and I have many ideas to improve it further. However, due to the requirements and time limitations, I focused on delivering the core features. I am confident that this project highlights my potential, and I look forward to demonstrating my skills during the internship.
